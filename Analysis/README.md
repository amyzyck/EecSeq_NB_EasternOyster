### Analysis Directory Workflow

This directory is broken into three sections: 
1. `Analysis_Part1` was performed on 4 adult oyster populations sampled in 2017. This analysis was completed in March and April of 2020.
2. `Analysis_Part2` was performed on the 4 original adult oyster populations sampled in 2017 and an additional 5 adult oyster populations sampled in 2020. This analysis was completed in February and March of 2023.
3. `Analysis_Final` was performed on the full sample set with resequenced data added and non-wild sample sites removed (NAR and GHP). This analysis wa completed in Summer and Fall 2024. 

Each section contains the following documentation of the analysis: 
1. `EecSeq_Cvirginica_dDocent.md`
2. `EecSeq_Cvirginica_Filtering.md`
3. `EecSeq_Cvirginica_OutlierDetection.md`
4. **PopGen_SeaGen_Analyses** directory

**In `Analysis_Final`, the dDocent and SNP Filtering steps are included in one markdown file `EecSeq_dDocent_SNPFiltering_Final.md`
