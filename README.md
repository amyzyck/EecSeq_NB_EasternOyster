## Background (project description)

During the summer of 2017, exposure trials were conducted using larvae from the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica). Wild adult broodstock were collected from Ipswich, MA and Barnstable, MA, and brought into the lab and conditioned for several weeks. Oysters were spawned via thermal induction and eggs from 7 females were fertilized with sperm from 11 males. Larvae were kept in ambient, filtered sea water for 16 hours to ensure all embryos had developed to the trochophore larval stage. After 16 hours, larvae were counted and approximately ~125,000 larvae were transferred to twelve 1 L glass mesocosms and four replicate 100,000 larvae subsamples were flash frozen (T0 ). Ambient water was adjusted to 100 mL and larvae were allowed to acclimate for 1 hour. After acclimation, one of four treatments were randomly assigned to each mesocosm (4 per treatment): CON-Control conditions, CA- Coastal Acidification treatment of ~2800 µatm pCO2 seawater, SE- Sewage Effluent treatment of 5% volume to volume ratio of treated sewage effluent to sea water, CASE- Coastal Acidification and Sewage Effluent treatment of 5% volume to volume ratio of treated sewage effluent to sea water ~2800 µatm pCO2. At 24 hours post-exposure (T24), larvae were filtered out of their experimental bottles and flash frozen to preserve the DNA and RNA. RNA was extracted from all samples, mRNA libraries were prepared and normalized, and probes were synthesized (adapter removal and biotin labeling).

Adult oysters were collected from 5 sites in Narragansett Bay (Figure 1), with 30 individuals from each site. Rectum, gill, and mantle tissue was dissected from each sample. DNA was then extracted from the tissue following the DNeasy Blood and Tissue extraction protocol and sheared down to 150 base pair fragments.

The probes, generated from the larval oyster mRNA, were then hybridized with the adult oyster DNA to capture expressed exon regions. After washing away non-target DNA regions and eluting the captured DNA off of the beads, the DNA is sequenced, resulting in a direct capture of genomic sequences that correspond to expressed genes (Puritz and Lotterhos 2018). The sequences obtained from this experiment will allow for the characterization of the genes that are relevant to CA and SE exposure as well as the examination of allele frequencies at target loci in adult populations that are exposed to these stressors in their natural habitat.

## Objectives
* Use sequence capture probes synthesized from CASE larval mRNA to capture expressed exon regions in adult oyster DNA
* Characterize genes that are relevant to CA and SE exposure in the adult oysters
* Investigate the effects of sewage effluent on adult oyster populations by examining differences in allele frequencies at target loci across populations
